        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
        Established in 2002, Rafting Company was born out of a shared passion for adventure and a love for the great outdoors. It all started when Liam Becerril, an avid outdoorsman and experienced rafting guide, envisioned creating a rafting company that would provide unforgettable experiences for adventurers of all ages and skill levels.
        In the early days, Liam Becerril and a small team of passionate guides set out to explore some of the most breathtaking rivers and rapids across the country. Their commitment to safety, professionalism, and environmental stewardship quickly earned them a reputation for excellence in the rafting community.
            
        As word spread about the thrilling adventures offered by Rafting Company, demand for their services grew steadily. With a focus on customer satisfaction and a dedication to delivering unforgettable experiences, the company expanded its operations, offering a wide range of rafting trips tailored to suit every adventurer's needs.

Today, we are proud to be recognized as a leader in the rafting industry, welcoming thousands of adventurers each year to explore the wonders of whitewater rafting with us.
